          <h4>Vission</h4>
          <p>
            Your content vision is a belief statement. It’s about your purpose —
            yours and nobody else’s. Without a content vision, you risk creating
            content devoid of meaning. Without meaning.

          <h4>Goals</h4>
          <p>
            I am learning basic HTML and CSS. I can build any professional
            website with Zoho Sites. I can even teach my friends circles how to
            make simple websites. My goal is to create three websites and learn
            advanced topics.
